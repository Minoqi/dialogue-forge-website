**Dialogue Forge** is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Pay once to get access to everything *including all future updates!*

Since the file gets exported as a JSON file, any engine/framework that can read JSON files can support this tool.

This includes but is not limited to *Unity, Unreal, Godot, Gamemaker, Construct, Love2D, Pygame, SDL, Raylib and Monogame*.
