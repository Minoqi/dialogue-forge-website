# Update
Hello, it's been a while! I made this project originally during a `backdrop jam`, and shortly after got a lot of freelance work which has stopped me from finding the time to work on the project ;-;

I've recently finished up another small tool I had started making this week as it's a tool I needed for another project. With that done, I'm hoping to get back into the development of this tool.

# The Big Hurdle
My biggest hurdle is figuring out how to analyze each line properly. With all my experience being in games, app development has me learning things I've never had to do which means lots of big real-time text input changes as well as properly analyzing different key inputs for saving. I suspect getting this working is what will take me the longest, so my next update will probably be one just for when thats done! That means that the decoding of each line & exporting would be fully functional and therefore technically useable, but of course extra things will be added on top once I've got the basis working :)

If you guys are working on anything let me know! I want to see ðŸ‘€
